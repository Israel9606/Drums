# Drums
Drum simulation using your keyboard

This proyect was made with the purpose of experimenting with javascript's event listeners , in this case i used the event listener of "keydown" with which it waits for when the user presses a key, and if it matches the key that i assigned then, using a switch statement, it plays a certain sound, imitaiting a certain part of a drum kit.

Alternatively, the user may also use his/her mouse to click on the desired sound they wish to make.

This proyect also implements the use of animations for each button, this way each time the user clicks or presses a key, the respective instrument flashes for a few seconds, simulating a "press".
